<h4 style=" text-align: justify; font-size:1rem;">
The recycling industry primarily focuses on the industrial and manufacturing sectors, however the recycling waste solutions team appreciates that the service sector generates large volumes of waste, and needs a proactive approach to segregate the waste before it is contaminated and mixed with non-=recyclable waste. 
We offer Waste segregations bins in all office buildings and compounds to allow adequate separation between all waste materials found in offices such as waste paper cans, plastic bottles, newspapers, and cardboard boxes.
